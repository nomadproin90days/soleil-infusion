# WF-06: No-Show Recovery

Triggers when an appointment is marked "No Show," tags the contact, waits 30 minutes, then sends a reschedule SMS followed by an email 2 days later; contacts who rebook have the no-show tag swapped for a rescheduled tag, while persistent no-shows are escalated to a manual call task.
